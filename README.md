# app_installer
This script will download the latest build of an app from the GitHub release assets, install it on a simulator, and launch it.

To use it you upload Xcode archives to the release assets on GitHub. It relies on a certain naming convention for the app archive. To see how to build and upload one, take a look at the [build script for TypeReader](https://github.com/onato/TypeReader/blob/main/scripts/build.sh).
